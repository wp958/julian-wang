### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [julian wang]

I'm a Philosophy student diving deep into the world of Computer Science and Mathematics. My goal is to find the future of philosophy, mathematics, and computer science, and I have a strong intuition that I will succeed.

- ðŸŒ± During Week 1-2, I am currently learning Python language and data structures, linear algebra, and calculus. 
- ðŸ¤” I am also seeking partners interested in philosophy or teachers who can answer my study questions.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... (Plato's Theory of Forms, or why `git rebase` can be scary)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 2903847966@qq.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: diachronic studies of Marxist theory, and the performance of large language models in addressing logical fallacies
